              <h3><mark>First Point</mark></h3>
              <p>"The First thing you need to do when you are kicked out,<br>
									is to know that nobody throws away what he values"
									If you are kicked out, you were never valued.
									Don't plan to win yourself back into such a place. 
									Sometimes, what seems to be our biggest pain shows us more of
									our miracles.God's intervention can hurt.
									Lot left Sodom with nothing.<br><br>
									<strong>Does it look like A miracle?</strong><br>
									When you are dropped, don't fight back into the ring.
									Forcing yourself I to someone who don't value you is like when
									you have agree to buy a rag.
								 	You will never wear it nor use it for a good purpose. 
									The same happend to you when you struggle too hard for someone
									to create a space for you in his or her life after he or she 
									has rejected you. <br>
									Nobody creates the gult to throw away something he values.
									If someone has thrown you away, God is announcing to you that 
									you have been the wrong place. Rise up and move on.<br> 
									What you want I to that person is not anywhere near to be 
									found.Someone else has it and that true person will show up.
									Give your life the chance to meet the right person. 
									Sometimes we love to over stay at the wrong place. 
									Why praying to God to make me someone who doesn't value you to
									love you?  God cannot join you in your ignorance?  Move on 
									towards the direction of the people that really have prayed 
									to meet you.</p>
              <h3><mark>Second point</mark></h3>
              <p><strong><i>"Disappointment is not a tragedy"</i></strong><br>
								The right person will burn every excuse to get you. 
								Your future is better than your pains. Focus on your future.
								Don't let someone's weakness become the prison you live inside. 
								If someone has failed you, give yourself a success challenge 
								and move. Don't fail yourself.
								There are always 10 persons better than the person you want to
								die for that you meet everyday. Every day gives you the
								opportunity to meet the right better people but sometimes,
								we are stocked on people who don't deserve us.
							</p>
              <h3><mark>Third Point</mark></h3>
              <p>Sometimes, the same only way God bring deliverance is to cut
								someone out of your life. Even though that God sent his angel to
								protect Hagar and her son, Ishmael, he still stood with Abraham
								decision to cut them off. That someone who cut you off is 
								prospering or doing well in life should not attract you back
								into his or her life. Abraham never ran back to Hagar because 
								of God's intervention in her life neither tried to reunite with
								Esau because of his wealth. Haha was Abraham biggest mistake
								and he acted very well when God gave him the opportunity to 
								close that wrong door. You will always get a more better person
								than the person that never saw the greatness in you. 
								Your destiny is your future. Move there.
								Anyone with the guy to ask you to leave will have gut to hurt
								you in many ways. The wrong people always bring pains.
								God cannot place to your blessings in the hands of the wrong
								person. When someone walks away from you, remind God that you
								are ready for the next biggest miracle. Ruth was barren and
								became a window but she reminded her mother in law that her 
								journey wasn't over with all those experiences. She moved into
								a land she was never part of it from birth and God opened the 
								heart of a successful and rich business man towards her. 
								You don't know who God is waiting  to open his or her heart 
								for you but the problem is that your mind is still stocked on 
								someone who is not part of God's vision and plan for you.
								God is not going to interrupt you until you interrupt 
								yourself and be free.
